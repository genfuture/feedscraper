The victim’s family alleged the crime was motivated by his role in leading witnesses in a related murder case involving the same accused.\n\nThe Manopad police under the guidance of CI P. Venkateshwarlu and SI Bhagwant Reddy conducted the investigation filing a charge sheet that led to the convictions. District SP Shri T. Srinivasa Rao IPS commended the police and legal team for ensuring justice.

The minister told the reporters that the Gadwal MLA had met the BRS leaders in the assembly lobbies only out of his old acquaintances, but not joined the BRS.\n\nHe said Krishna Mohan Reddy would remain with the Congress and not join any other party, including the BRS.\n\nIt was only on Tuesday that the Gadwal MLA met with BRS Working President K Taraka Rama Rao and other leaders at the BRS Legislature Party office on the assembly premises and expressed his desire to rejoin the party.\n\nHe had joined the Congress party on July 6 in the presence of Chief Minister and TPCC President A Revanth Reddy and other leaders. However, he was reportedly unhappy with the party and regretted his decision.\n\nDuring his meeting with KTR, Krishna Mohan Reddy requested permission for \"Ghar Wapasi\" (homecoming), which was accepted.\n\nBRS leaders expressed hope that a majority of the nine other MLAs who had switched loyalties to the ruling Congress would also return to the BRS fold.\n\nKrishna Mohan Reddy was part of a group of former BRS MLAs who made the switch, including Kale Yadaiah (Chevella), Pocharam Srinivas Reddy (Banswada), Sanjay Kumar (Jagtial), Danam Nagendra (Khairatabad), Kadiyan Srihari (Station Ghanpur), and Tellam Venkat Rao (Bhadrachalam).",

        "text": "In a political development that may hinder the ‘defections’ into the ruling party for some time, Gadwal MLA Bandla Krishnamohan Reddy, who joined the Congress four weeks ago, is set to return to Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS).\n\nMr. Reddy met BRS working president K.T. Rama Rao (KTR) at the BRS Legislature Party (BRSLP) office in the Assembly building on Tuesday and expressed his desire to continue in the party as officially he is still recognised as a BRS member.\n\nHe was the seventh MLA from the party to have joined Congress, on July 6, 2024. Of the 10 BRS MLAs who joined the Congress, Mr. Reddy is the first one to return to parent party. The Gadwal MLA is considered to be close to KTR.\n\nThe reasons\n\nThe reasons, he quoted to the BRS leaders, were pressure from the family that was unhappy with switching sides and also opposition from the local Congress cadre, who were not welcoming him. KTR is reported to have asked him to meet BRS chief K. Chandrashekhar Rao soon.\n\nBhadrachalam MLA creates discomfort\n\nBhadrachalam MLA Tellam Venkat Rao, elected on the BRS ticket and joined the Congress later, also created some discomfort among the Congress party as he walked into the BRSLP office on Tuesday along with Balkonda MLA and former minister Prashanth Reddy. He spent some time in the office along with the BRS MLAs before going to the Assembly.\n\nHowever, he has not clarified whether he will be returning to the BRS. Sources close to him said he has joined the Congress and he would continue to remain there. Mr. Venkat Rao, a close follower of Minister for Revenue Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy had joined the Congress along with him before the elections.\n\nBut he returned to the BRS again just before the Assembly elections secured the BRS party ticket from Bhadrachalam and won. He joined the Congress soon after the elections. The meeting of two MLAs with the BRS leaders created some confusion and also some tension among the Congress circles.\n\nWill not allow the return of a few MLAs\n\nA senior BRS leader told The Hindu that the party would not welcome back some BRS MLAs even if they wished to. He was referring to some senior MLAs who walked out of the party despite getting plum posts during the two terms of the BRS. “It is not like we will open the gates easily to those who want to return,” he said.\n\nA blow to CM Revanth\n\nBRS leaders also feel that Gadwal MLA coming back to the party was a blow to Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy as he was personally monitoring the joinings of BRS MLAs. “This move will push some fence-sitters into second thoughts of leaving the BRS. What confidence will we have in the Congress if an MLA is returning to the BRS,” he questioned.\n\nHe was the seventh MLA from the party to have joined Congress, on July 6, 2024. Of the 10 BRS MLAs who joined Congress, Mr. Reddy is the first one to return to the parent party. The Gadwal MLA is considered to be close to KTR",

According to sources, the gas agency staff deflected the blame, suggesting that the residents go and speak to Reddy if they had concerns about the subsidy payments.\n\nThis response did not sit well with the locals, who were expecting the subsidy as promised under the government’s welfare scheme.

He too suggested them to resign from the posts they have now as BRS members before joining Congress.\n\nMr. Keshava Rao also expressed his desire to resign as a Rajya Sabha member as he was elected on behalf of the BRS party and contest in the by poll if Congress gives him another chance. He held senior positions in the Congress before joining the BRS a few months before the formation of Telangana. He served as a Minister in several Congress governments and was later appointed president of the Andhra Pradesh Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) in the combined state.\n\nThe Congress may not benefit from their induction numbers-wise, but it would be a big jolt to the BRS which is already struggling with desertions ahead of the Parliament elections. Ms. Vijayalakshmi’s entry will boost the Congress party’s numbers in the GHMC council as several BRS Corporators are expected to follow her soon. Former GHMC Deputy Mayor Baba Fasiuddin, a close follower of BRS working president K.T. Rama Rao, has already joined the Congress.\n\nThe BRS, which has won the majority of MLA seats in the GHMC area, will face a tough task in retaining the MLAs as the Congress claimed that several MLAs were in touch with them to jump the ship. It is expected that once the defections begin, the Corporators too would join the stream. Khairatabad BRS MLA Danam Nagander, a former Congress man has already deserted the party.",

He further accused the authorities of ignoring farmers' grievances, alleging that the district Collector and police had dismissed requests to discuss these pressing issues.\n\nThe protestors also criticised what they see as a lack of empathy from officials, contrasting the current handling of farmer grievances with a recent incident in Bijwaram village, where police facilitated a young girl's funeral with heavy security. Farmers expressed anger at being barred from discussing their issues at the Collector's office, claiming this reflects poorly on the Congress administration’s approach to governance.\n\nThe protesters demanded an immediate resolution to the pending Rythu Bharosa disbursements, urging the government to address farmers' financial needs without further delay.",

Rajeshwari reportedly took her own life after alleged harassment and false accusations of theft by her employer, a prominent local seed organizer.\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread public and political outcry, with allegations of police negligence and favoritism due to the accused’s influential connections. According to reports, Rajeshwari was employed as a domestic worker at the home of Bandla Rajasekhar Reddy, a known seed organizer in Gadwal. The family and BRS leaders allege that Reddy accused her of theft, pressuring her under the weight of unsubstantiated claims. Unable to bear the humiliation, Rajeshwari is said to have consumed pesticide, which led to her tragic death.\n\nBRS leaders, along with activists from the Nadigadda Rights Struggle Committee, visited Rajeshwari’s family to offer condolences and pledged their support in seeking justice. During the visit, Dr. RS Praveen Kumar condemned the alleged mistreatment of the minor girl and criticized the police for initially omitting Reddy’s name from the First Information Report (FIR). He accused local law enforcement of showing bias by protecting the accused due to his political influence.\n\nAddressing the media, Dr. Kumar called for immediate and strict action against Reddy, along with an impartial investigation into the role of\n\nlocal police officers who allegedly mishandled the case. \"We will not rest until those responsible for this innocent girl's death are brought to justice,\" he stated, adding that justice for Rajeshwari should serve as a deterrent to prevent the exploitation of minors in the future.\n\nFormer minister Srinivas Goud echoed these sentiments, demanding that Reddy be held accountable for his actions. \"Exploitation and abuse of vulnerable communities cannot be tolerated. We will ensure this case does not go ignored,\" he said.Local activists and leaders from multiple organizations held a rally in support of Rajeshwari's family, urging authorities to investigate the broader influence of seed organizers in the district. They argue that some powerful figures use their connections to avoid accountability, further marginalizing vulnerable groups.\n\nThe BRS leaders also highlighted the need for stronger protections for minors, calling on the government to address the prevalence of child labor and exploitation in rurallabor and exploitation in rural areas. They expressed concerns that Rajeshwari's case represents broader issues facing marginalized families in Telangana, urging the state to implement policies to protect children from similar fates.\n\nAs the case continues to unfold, calls for a fair and transparent investigation grow louder, with the BRS leadership pledging to pursue justice relentlessly. Rajeshwari's death has not only brought attention to her personal tragedy but has also sparked a wider Conversation about child exploitation and power dynamics, and police accountability.",

He expressed that such an incident could not have occurred without the involvement of the TTD Executive Officer, the temple administration, and even the state's cabinet and endowments department. He emphasized that adulterating laddus is not a minor issue and raised concerns about the influence of the Endowments Department on Hindu temples.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwamy criticized the government for bringing only temples with significant revenue under the control of the Endowments Department, while ignoring thousands of temples with no income. He lamented that many temples are struggling to provide basic offerings like incense, lamps, and food offerings, and lack proper upkeep and patronage. He questioned why only Hindu temples are being managed under the Endowments Department in a secular country and why churches and mosques are not subjected to the same control.\n\n\n\nSwamy further expressed concern that in rural areas, many temples do not conduct regular rituals, which is leading Hindu youth astray, pushing them toward addictions like alcohol and drugs. He urged parents to teach their children devotion and instill religious values from a young age, suggesting that families should visit temples regularly. He stressed that at least once a week, families should visit a temple to receive blessings, which would not only ensure the well-being and health of their families but also guide children on the right path and contribute to building a better society.\n\nSwamy also announced the launch of the \"Mana Gudi Mana Dharma\" (Our Temple, Our Religion) program in Alampur Mandal, Jogulamba Gadwal District, to raise awareness among Hindu families about their religious duties. Under this initiative, weekly gatherings will be held at different temples, where collective worship, devotional songs, and bhajans will be conducted to promote the revival of Hindu values. He called on every Hindu citizen, at the village, state, and national levels, to take responsibility for spreading and protecting Sanatana Dharma.\n\n\n\nPulikal Veeresh and Chagadona Satish, among others, participated in the program.\n\n",

Due to this, Reddy met with the BRS working president, K T Rama Rao, on Tuesday and said that he would continue in BRS only.\n\nGhar Wapsi to BRS\n\nThe return of BRS MLA is being seen as a setback to the ruling Congress party which had managed to switch 10 MLA's on their side.\n\nGhar Wapsi was prompted by the constant resistance of the Congress cadre. G Niranjan, senior vice-president of the Congress party, says, \"The cadre was not happy with him as they have been fighting against him for the last 10 years. How is it possible for them to now embrace him? Also, his presence would mean that the state leadership would be guided by what he portrays to them. This was not acceptable to the cadre.\"\n\nPanchayat elections\n\nThe panchayat elections are round the corner and those who are close to the MLA's in the constituency will play a major role. The Congress workers in Gadwal are queuing up with their representative. Congress MLA contestant Saritha Thirupataiah lost the election with a margin of 7036 votes and she has been opposing the presence of BRS MLA in the party.\n\n\"All these factors will play a major role in the panchayat elections,\" explained sources in Congress.\n\nOpposition of senior Congress leader Jeevan Reddy\n\nSenior Congress leader Jeevan Reddy also strongly opposed the inclusion of BRS MLA Dr Sanjiv Kumar in the party from Jagityal constituency. He was upset over the party welcoming his political rival and BRS MLA Dr A Sanjay Kumar without his knowledge. Jeevan Reddy threatened to quit the party. Senior Congress leaders of Telangana deputy chief minister Bhatti Vikramarka, information minister Sridhar Babu and other leaders first tried to placate him. Finally chief minister Revanth Reddy also met him in Delhi along with AICC in-charge for Telangana Deepa Dasmunshi.\n\nRevanth Reddy pointed out that confusion arose as PCC did not take necessary steps on political developments happening in the Jagtial Assembly segment. He claimed that there was a misunderstanding and both Central and State leadership of Congress have assured Jeevan Reddy that his role and importance within the party would remain intact. The Congress government would also seek suggestions and advice from Jeevan Reddy.\n\nIn the case of Krishna Mohan Reddy, due to the strong resistance from cadre, it is alleged that chief minister Revanth Reddy also sidelined him.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nBRS had won 39 of the total 119 Assembly constituencies in the elections, while Congress came to power winning 64 seats.\n\nHowever, BRS MLA from Secunderabad Cantonment, G Lasya Nanditha, died in a road accident earlier this year. Congress won the by-poll for the Secunderabad Cantonment Assembly segment. This led to an increase in its strength to 65.\n\nWith addition of 10 BRS MLAs who crossed over to Congress, its strength rose to 75. However, Reddy has returned to the BRS fold. Others who are not getting support are also planning to come back to BRS, according to sources.\n\nSix BRS MLCs have also joined the ruling party recently. With these defections, Congress' strength goes up to 10 in the 40-member Legislative Council.",

        "text": "The steady, rhythmic rattle of the looms is audible as we enter a house in Injapuram, on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Brothers Yadagiri and Nagaraj, who were earlier part of the Gadwal silk weaving community at Amangal, Ranga Reddy district, in Telangana, now oversee the 12-loom Kanjeevaram unit in Injapuram, established by Hyderabad-based textile designer Gaurang Shah.\n\nThere is a steady output of premium handwoven Kanjeevaram saris from these looms, with some of them reviving heritage designs and colours. Gaurang had initially collaborated with weavers in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, but it required frequent travelling to oversee the weaving process. “There was also the risk of designs being plagiarised or our supply of pure silver and gold zari threads being replaced with non-genuine material,” he explains. When the erstwhile Gadwal weavers from Amangal expressed interest in working on Kanjeevaram saris, it turned out to be a win-win situation for the weavers and the designer.\n\n“The weaving process is not very different for Gadwal and Kanchi silk saris,” says Gaurang. While a few weavers who knew the basics of Gadwal weaving joined the team, others with no prior weaving experience were trained.\n\nInspired by temple sculptures\n\nOn these looms, Gaurang is on a mission to revive some of the traditional designs inspired by sculptures in the temples of Tamil Nadu. For instance, he shows a design sheet that features a procession of elephants and has motifs of chakras, temple pillars and animal figures. “Some of the old sculptures we came across had designs that fuse the body of one animal with the head of another. We have tried to bring back such designs,” he explains.\n\nDesigns are hand drawn, then computerised to be transferred or punched on cards. The punched cards, with holes, are used in the jacquard on the looms. This mechanised transfer of designs on the jacquard looms allows complex patterns to be woven with ease.\n\nThe warping process, which used to be done by hand in the early years, is now mechanised. The weft yarn is then transferred to the bobbins with the help of charkhas. A spindle fill the weft yarns into bobbins for the shuttles. In these looms, simple weights such as water bottles filled with sand help maintain the tension of the warp.\n\nGaurang explains how the Kanchi saris are known for their contrasting borders that differ from the body of the sari. He shows a sari and explains, “The warp is pure gold zari while the weft is blue.” At the other end of the loom, yarn in the traditional ‘arakku’ colour (a deep pink-red hue)is awaiting the loom process.\n\nYarn to sari, under one roof\n\nOn the terrace of the spacious house, dyers mix dyes to match the shade selected from a shade card. They dip the yarn in boiling water and then mix in the colour before it is dipped again. Yadagiri explains, “Since the silk yarn is procured locally and everything from the warping to the dyeing and weaving process is done in-house, we have a control over the quality.”\n\nOn average, the weavers manage to complete three silk saris a month. Yadagiri says production slows down during peak monsoon since damp weather is not conducive to the Kanchi weaving process. The price of saris woven here ranges from ₹50,000 to ₹5 lakh or more, depending on the intricacies of the design and the zari. “I pay weavers ₹30,000 to weave a single shuttle sari which takes nearly 12 days, and ₹45,000 to ₹50,000 for a three-shuttle sari which takes 25 days,” says Gaurang.\n\nThe Injapuram Kanchi weaving facility was established three years ago and the designer hopes to expand it to 20 looms, depending on how soon he can get more new weavers to join the group.\n\n(The writer visited these looms on invitation)",

        "text": "Gadwal: A significant incident of water wastage has occurred in Gadwal district, where a section of the Mission Bhagiratha pipeline has burst, resulting in large amounts of water flowing wastefully into the open. The pipeline ruptured near Kothula Gidda Stage in Dharur Mandal, causing a visible spill of water that could have been better utilized.\n\nMission Bhagiratha Pipeline Burst\n\nThe pipeline, part of the Mission Bhagiratha project aimed at providing safe drinking water to rural areas across Telangana, suffered a major rupture, leading to water gushing out in a steady stream. Locals have expressed concerns about the damage and the environmental impact of the water loss.\n\nAlso Read: Confidential Family Survey Documents Found Discarded on Road in Medchal\n\n“Water is a precious resource, and it is disheartening to see so much of it being wasted due to such technical failures. The government needs to address these issues immediately,” said a resident of the area.\n\nImpact on Water Supply and Local Communities\n\nThe Mission Bhagiratha project, launched by the Telangana government, is intended to supply drinking water to rural areas, but incidents like this pipeline burst raise questions about the reliability and maintenance of the infrastructure. While the pipeline rupture has been quickly reported, immediate repairs are necessary to prevent further wastage and disruption in water supply.\n\nThe rupture has also affected the nearby localities that depend on the water supply for daily use. Locals have urged authorities to address the problem urgently to restore water access.\n\nGovernment Response and Repairs Underway\n\nOfficials from the Telangana Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Department (TDWSSD) have been alerted about the situation, and repair work has reportedly begun. The government has committed to resolving the issue swiftly to ensure that residents of Dharur Mandal and surrounding areas continue to receive their regular water supply.\n\n“We are aware of the leak in the Mission Bhagiratha pipeline near Kothula Gidda and are taking immediate steps to repair the damage. Our teams are on the ground to fix the issue and prevent further wastage,” said a government official.\n\nCall for Better Maintenance and Infrastructure Upgrades\n\nThe incident has sparked concerns about the overall maintenance and longevity of the Mission Bhagiratha pipeline network, especially as the state pushes forward with water supply projects in rural areas. Experts have stressed the need for regular inspections and timely repairs to avoid such issues in the future.\n\nWith water conservation becoming an urgent priority in many regions, ensuring the efficiency of large-scale water supply projects like Mission Bhagiratha is essential for meeting the needs of rural communities across Telangana.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the pipeline burst in Gadwal district highlights the challenges of maintaining vast infrastructure projects, the Telangana government’s quick response aims to minimize the damage. As work on repairs continues, authorities are working to ensure that the water wastage is stopped and that the supply remains uninterrupted for the affected communities.",

        "text": "Hyderabad: In a surprising turn of events, Bandla Krishna Mohan Reddy, MLA from Gadwal constituency, rejoined the BRS just days after defecting to the ruling Congress party on Tuesday.\n\nReddy, who had left the party on July 6, surfaced at the BRS Legislature Party chambers in the Legislative Assembly premises and met BRS working president K.T. Rama Rao to express his desire to return to the party fold.\n\nParty sources said that Rama Rao immediately called up his father and BRS chief K. Chandrashekar Rao and sought his approval. Chandrashekar Rao reportedly gave his nod following which Reddy rejoined the party, BRS leaders claimed.\n\nSpeculations were rife in BRS circles that three more party MLAs, who had defected to the Congress, including Kale Yadaiah (Chevella), Gudem Mahipal Reddy (Patancheru) and Tellam Venkat Rao (Bhadrachalam) are in contact with BRS leadership and are willing to rejoin BRS.\n\nThe reasons behind Krishna Mohan's swift change of allegiance are not immediately clear. However, it has been reported that he felt uncomfortable within the Congress ranks. Notably, Congress workers from the Gadwal constituency had expressed opposition to his entry into their party, adding to the complexity of the situation.\n\nThe return of Krishna Mohan is a notable development for BRS as it provides some relief, following the series of defections. Since March, BRS has lost ten MLAs, six MLCs, and several senior leaders to Congress. This includes a major setback in the Secunderabad Cantonment Assembly by-election, where its candidate was defeated by Congress, reducing its strength in the Assembly.\n\nWith Krishna Mohan's re-entry, BRS hopes to stabilise its position in the state Assembly. The party, which initially secured 39 seats in the 119-member House, saw its numbers dwindle to 28 due to defections and electoral losses.\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress party's strength increased to 72 seats, bolstered by the recent influx of BRS MLAs.\n\nIn a different development, BRS Medchal MLA Ch. Malla Reddy went to the CLP office in the Assembly and met Deputy Chief Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka on Tuesday. This fuelled speculations about a possible switching of loyalties. However, later Malla Reddy clarified that he had met Vikramarka to seek funds for his constituency and there was no other political significance.\n\nMeanwhile, a picture of Bhadrachalam BRS MLA Tellam Venkat Rao, who defected to Congress, having a conversation with BRS MLAs in the\n\nassembly lobby on Tuesday went viral on social media and fuelled speculations of his 'ghar wapsi'. However, Tellam said that there was no truth in the rumours. “It is not right to spread such rumours against me. It is not right to send pictures of me having tea with BRS MLAs in the Assembly lobby,” Rao said.\n\nMaking light of this incident, minister Komatireddy Venkat Reddy said that the media had blown the issue out of proportion. \"Where did Krishna Mohan say that he is rejoining BRS? Did he tell the media about this? BRS leaders are spreading lies on this.\"\n\nCongress MLA Yennam Srinivas Reddy also denied reports that Krishna Mohan was ill-treated in the Congress.\n\n\"We have given him due importance. He is facing some issues in his constituency with Congress leaders and former Gadwal zilla parishad chairperson Saritha, who contested against him in the Assembly polls. That could be the reason for his disappointment.\"",

Holding Congress party flags and raising slogans, Sarita’s supporters squatted in front of the convoy.\n\nThe minister and his associates tried in vain to convince Sarita’s followers to allow the minsiter to go with the assurance that he would stop at her house while returning. However, so incensed were the Congress workers that they raised “Jupally down down” slogans. The minister’s repeated assurances that he would call on her in his return journey fell on deaf ears.\n\nAs the situation was turning worse, the Minister’s followers convinced him to visit Saritha Tirupataiah’s residence first. Heeding to their requests, he went to Sarita’s residence first and then proceeded to attend his official programmes.\n\nThe stiff opposition by Congress leaders over the entry of BRS MLAs into the Congress has been continuing. Krishnamohan Reddy had defected to the Congress and then later expressed his willingness to join the BRS again, but within a day changed his mind again to stick with the Congress.",

Ever since BRS MLA B Krishnamohan Reddy defected to Congress, the party incharge and former Zilla Parishad Chairperson Saritha Tirupataiah has been locking horns with the former over different issues.\n\nThis time, the two groups engaged in a battle over appointment of chairman for Gadwal Market Committee.

The event took place at NBT Nagar in Banjara Hills, where organisers reportedly played music well past the permitted time.\n\nThe police have registered a case under Sections 223, 280 and 292 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) for disobeying orders issued by public servants, creating a noxious atmosphere harmful to health and causing public nuisance.\n\nA video of the event, widely circulated on social media, shows the mayor standing on a dais, holding a sword, and urging women to wield swords as well. The video drew significant backlash online.\n\nIn response to the criticism, the mayor took to X (formerly Twitter) and addressed the incident, stating, “There was an issue concerning women in the area. I assured the women that no one could take advantage of them and that I had been addressing their concerns. I believe there is nothing wrong in standing by them when they need me.”",

Party sources said that the BRS supreme was upset with KK’s decision as he enjoyed every position during the decade-long rule of KCR and wanted to quit when the party needed his experience. “The party treated him with respect and gave him freedom to work,” KCR said to have observed.\n\nOn the other hand, the shift of loyalty by Gadwal Vijaya Lakshmi could be considered as the Congress party’s effort to strengthen its position in the GHMC region, the stronghold of the BRS.\n\nMeanwhile, KK’s son, Kancharla Viplav Kumar, who was ex-chairman for TS Urban Finance Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd denied his hand in the shifting of loyalty by his father and sister to the Congress.

The rally, led by District Chairman Gongalla Ranjith Kumar, began at the Nadi gadda Rights Struggle Committee office and proceeded to the Krishnaveni Chowrasta in Gadwal.\n\nCommittee leaders and activists paid tribute to Rajeswari, holding her photograph and lighting candles in her memory.During the event, Chairman Gongalla Ranjith Kumar stated that Rajeswari's death was a tragic result of her inability to cope with the humiliation she faced. Allegedly wrongfully accused of theft, she reportedly ingested pesticide in an attempt to end her life. She later succumbed to the effects of the poison. Ranjith Kumar strongly demanded immediate legal action against prominent seed organizer Bandla Rajasekhar Reddy, whom he claims is responsible for Rajeswari's death. According to Kumar, Rajeswari was wrongfully implicated in a theft case, and despite her repeated denials, police at the Maldakal Police Station continued to pressure her, failing to consider her age or the impact on her family. He alleged that Rajasekhar Reddy, who has avoided arrest, manipulated the system with his political influence to evade accountability.\n\nRanjith Kumar emphasized that there are multiple layers to the circumstances surrounding Rajeswari's death, calling for an impartial investigation into all angles of the case anddemanding Rajasekhar Reddy's arrest and strict punishment. He announced plans to take the matter to the State DGP soon and warned that the Nadigadda Rights Struggle Committee would intensify its protests across the district if justice is not served for Rajeswari's family. Kumar also called on the government to support the bereaved family.\n\nSeveral committee members and leaders participated in the event, including District Convenor Bucchibabu, District Secretary Lavanna, poet Avani shree, leaders\n\nRangaswami and Venkataramulu, Gadwal Mandal leaders Gouni Srinivas Yadav, Karthik, Maldakal Mandal President B.

Street vendors participating in these initiatives are provided with free hygiene kits, including aprons, head caps, and gloves, to encourage safe food handling practices.\n\nDespite ongoing efforts by Hyderabad’s food safety teams, violations continue to be found in some restaurants in Hyderabad.

Health experts warn that consuming adulterated toddy poses several serious health risks due to the presence of harmful additives and contaminants.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Risks Identified :-\n\n\n\nCommon side effects reported include:\n\nNausea and Vomiting : The presence of adulterants can severely irritate the stomach lining, leading to frequent bouts of nausea and vomiting.\n\nDiarrhea : Contaminants found in adulterated toddy can disrupt the digestive system, causing persistent diarrhea.\n\nAbdominal Pain : Consumers often experience severe stomach cramps due to harmful substances in the toddy.\n\nHeadaches : Chemicals used in the adulteration process can lead to debilitating headaches.\n\nDizziness and Confusion : Certain substances in adulterated toddy affect the nervous system, resulting in dizziness and confusion.\n\nRespiratory Issues : Some chemicals used in adulteration can cause significant breathing difficulties.\n\nLiver Damage : Long-term consumption of adulterated toddy is associated with liver toxicity and potential liver damage.\n\nNeurological Effects : Harmful chemicals can lead to neurological symptoms such as tremors, seizures, and other severe effects.\n\nCardiovascular Problems : Adulterants can impact heart rate and blood pressure, potentially causing serious cardiovascular issues.\n\nAllergic Reactions : Unknown substances in the toddy can trigger allergic reactions, ranging from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis.\n\nSevere Consequences\n\n\n\nIn extreme cases, highly adulterated toddy can lead to organ failure or even death. Health authorities stress the importance of seeking immediate medical attention if severe symptoms are experienced after consuming toddy.\n\n\n\nGovernment Response:\n\n\n\nIn response to these alarming developments, District SP Mr. T. Srinivas Rao, IPS, has issued strict directives to the Excise and Police officials to ensure that licensed kallu (toddy) shops in the district are free from adulteration. The SP has mandated thorough investigations and severe punishment for those responsible for selling adulterated toddy.\n\n\n\nMr. Rao emphasized the need for regular checks and inspections in kallu shops and depots. He instructed officials to collect samples from suspicious establishments for lab testing and to take stringent action against those found guilty of adulteration. Additionally, unauthorized kallu shops are to be closely monitored to prevent their operation.\n\n\n\nCoordination Efforts:\n\nA coordination meeting was held in the SP’s chamber with police and excise officials to discuss the measures to be taken. During the meeting, Excise officials provided details about licensed kallu shops in Gadwal and Alampur constituencies, highlighting potential areas for adulteration.\n\nCommunity Impact :\n\n\n\nThe community, particularly laborers and daily wage workers, who are the primary consumers of toddy, are most affected by this issue. The high cost of medical treatments for those affected by adulterated toddy exacerbates the problem, placing a heavy burden on already vulnerable populations.\n\n",

        "publish_date": "2024-08-20",
        "text": "Gadwal: The heavy rains that occurred in the early hours of Tuesday in the Alampur constituency of Jogulamba Gadwal district have brought to light several critical issues related to infrastructure, disaster preparedness, and the socio-economic impact on the local population. The event underscores the vulnerability of the region to extreme weather conditions and the cascading effects on daily life, transportation, and agriculture.\n\nInfrastructure Vulnerability:\n\nThe flooding of the main road connecting Raichur in Karnataka to Alampur due to the overflow of the Pedda Vagu stream highlights the inadequate infrastructure resilience in the region. The fact that a major transportation route was rendered unusable for several hours points to the need for improved drainage systems and the construction of flood-resistant infrastructure. This road serves as a crucial link for both people and goods between the states, and its disruption not only isolates communities but also hampers economic activities.\n\nDisruption of Daily Life:\n\nThe flooding led to the isolation of several villages, including Tupatrala, Medikonda, Pulikal, Chinna Tandrapadu, Venisompuram, and Keshavaram. Residents in these areas found themselves stranded, unable to access essential services or travel to work. This kind of disruption can have lasting effects, especially for daily wage laborers and small businesses that rely on consistent access to markets and customers.\n\nThe temporary isolation of these villages also raises concerns about the availability of emergency services. In situations where medical emergencies or other critical needs arise, the lack of accessible roads can turn a manageable situation into a life-threatening one. The local authorities' warnings to avoid travel were a necessary precaution, but they also highlight the lack of alternative routes or transportation options in times of crisis.\n\nAgricultural Impact:\n\nPerhaps one of the most significant impacts of the heavy rains is on agriculture, which is the primary livelihood for many residents in the Alampur constituency. The flooding of fields, particularly during the crop-growing season, can have devastating effects. Farmers have reported that their crops, which were in the growth phase, have been submerged by the sudden influx of water. This has led to an estimated loss of up to ₹40,000 per acre, a significant financial hit for small and marginal farmers.\n\nThe timing of the rains, when crops are particularly vulnerable, exacerbates the situation. Continuous heavy rains can lead to waterlogging, which damages the roots of crops and reduces yield. For many farmers, this could mean not just a loss of income but also a potential shortage of food supplies in the coming months.\n\nEducation and Public Safety:\n\nIn the aftermath of the rains, there have been calls from parents in the affected villages for the closure of schools in areas where streams and rivulets have overflowed. This concern is valid, given the risks associated with children traveling through flooded areas. The disruption of education, even temporarily, can have a cumulative effect, especially in rural areas where access to quality education is already limited.\n\nPublic safety remains a critical issue. The lack of real-time information about which areas are most affected by flooding means that residents are often left to navigate dangerous conditions with little guidance. This underscores the need for improved communication strategies, including the use of social media and local media outlets, to keep the public informed during such events.\n\nNeed for Proactive Measures:\n\nThe recurring nature of such weather events calls for more proactive measures from both local and state governments. While immediate responses like warnings and advisories are crucial, long-term solutions are needed to mitigate the impact of heavy rains on the region. These could include the construction of better drainage systems, flood barriers, and the elevation of key roads and bridges.\n\nAdditionally, there should be a focus on disaster preparedness training for local communities, ensuring that residents know how to respond in the event of sudden flooding. Investment in early warning systems that can predict and communicate the risks of flooding before they occur would also be beneficial.\n\nThe heavy rains in the Alampur constituency are a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by rural areas in dealing with extreme weather. The disruption of transportation, the isolation of communities, the damage to crops, and the impact on education all highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to disaster management and infrastructure development. By addressing these issues, the region can become more resilient to future weather events, ensuring that the livelihoods and safety of its residents are better protected.",

The Krishna and Godavari rivers are overflowing due to the excessive rains in the upper areas and river basins. The Jurala dam in Gadwal district is also facing flooding as a result of heavy rains in upstream Karnataka.\n\nCurrently, the Jurala dam is receiving a flood flow of 92,000 cusecs, leading officials to open 17 gates of the project and release a flood of 67,000 cusecs downstream. Additionally, 33,000 cusecs of water is being released downstream through power generation. The water level in the dam has reached 317.17 meters, close to its full capacity of 318.516 meters.\n\nFurthermore, approximately one lakh cusecs of floodwater from Jurala is expected to reach the Srisailam reservoir. Officials are concerned that the flood could worsen if the rains persist. Meanwhile, the Sriramsagar reservoir is also experiencing a continuous flow of floodwater.\n\nThe state government is closely monitoring the situation and taking necessary steps to manage the flooding in the affected areas.",

        "text": "Gadwal: In a significant political development, Nagar Doddi Venkatramulu, a seasoned leader and stalwart of the BRS party, is making waves among the people of Nadigadda. Venkatramulu, who has a long history of involvement in the Telangana movement, is being whispered about as the next in line for BRS leadership in the Gadwal constituency.\n\nThe recent political shift in Gadwal has been noteworthy. MLA Bandla Krishnamohan Reddy, who was elected under the BRS party symbol, has switched allegiance to the Congress party along with his followers. This unexpected move has created a vacuum in the BRS party's leadership in the district, prompting deliberations among the remaining senior leaders about who will take up the mantle.\n\nAmong the prominent figures being considered for the leadership role is Nagar Doddi Venkatramulu. Known for his close association with BRS party chief K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), Venkatramulu is a respected member of the BRS Politburo. His popularity and influence within the party, especially in the Gadwal constituency, make him a strong contender for the position.\n\nVenkatramulu's political journey is marked by his unwavering commitment to the Telangana movement. He previously contested as a Mahajan Front candidate in 1999 and as a joint candidate for the Congress and TRS parties in 2004, although both attempts ended in defeat. Despite these setbacks, Venkatramulu remained steadfast in his dedication to the cause and became a prominent figure during the Jogulamba Gadwal movement. His accessibility and spirit of activism have left an indelible mark on the people of Nadigadda.\n\nDespite not receiving the party ticket he hoped for in the last assembly elections, Venkatramulu stayed loyal to the BRS leadership. He worked tirelessly for the victory of the party candidates in both the 2018 and 2023 assembly elections. His non-introverted nature and longstanding association with the party bolster his position as a potential leader during the party's time in power.\n\nAdding to his appeal is Venkatramulu's background as a member of the Backward Classes (BC) community, which enhances his popularity over the current MLA, Bandla Krishnamohan Reddy. The people of Gadwala hold Venkatramulu in high regard, seeing him as a key figure who contributed significantly to the Telangana movement. His potential elevation to BRS leadership is seen as a move towards justice and recognition of his years of dedication and service.\n\nAs discussions among senior BRS leaders intensify, there is a growing consensus that Venkatramulu might finally be given the reins of leadership in the upcoming 2024 elections. The heart-beating information among the people of Gadwal is that the senior leaders of the BRS party are taking steps towards bringing Venkatramulu into a leadership role that reflects his contributions and loyalty.\n\nWith the political landscape in Gadwal evolving rapidly, all eyes are on the BRS party's next steps and Venkatramulu's future role. His leadership could bring renewed vigor and direction to the party, solidifying its position in the district and ensuring continued progress and development for the people of Gadwal.",

He remarked that under the current Congress government, arrests have become routine, especially targeting opposition leaders, students, and activists. He condemned the actions as an attempt to suppress dissent and stifle a strong opposition, which he argued is essential for the welfare of the people.\n\nRamulu further accused the ruling party of orchestrating the attack on MLA Kaushik Reddy after he held a press meet criticizing defections.

Ramulu urged the Congress government to focus on solving public issues rather than suppressing opposition voices.\n\nHe also condemned the preemptive arrests in Gadwal constituency, stating that such actions were an attack on democratic rights.

The use of DJ systems during religious processions also increases the chances of uncontrolled behaviour by participants, potentially leading to law and order issues, the police had stated.\n\nAdditionally, the use of firecrackers in procession routes in Hyderabad crowded with hundreds or thousands of people poses a significant danger.\n\nAlso Read Hyderabad Mayor, Corporators meet Yogi during study tour in Lucknow\n\nAlthough DJs are banned during religious processions in Hyderabad, sound systems are permitted, but with restrictions on sound decibel limits.",

(X)\n\nBRS Parliamentary Party leader K Keshava Rao and his mayor-daughter Gadwal Vijayalaxmi will join the Congress soon.\n\nWhile it is not known when Keshava Rao will jump ship, Vijayalaxmi is expected to join the Congress on 30 March in the presence of Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy.\n\nTheir decision should be a very rude jolt to the BRS, which has been struggling in the political bullring as its leaders leave one after the other in a metronymic rhythm.\n\nThe die had been cast for Keshava Rao and his daughter to return to Congress when the national party’s Telangana in-charge Deepa Dasmunsi and chief minister’s advisor Vem Narender Reddy called on them at his Banjara Hills residence on 12 March and invited them to join the grand old party.\n\nThe veteran leader and former minister was the president of the Pradesh Congress Committee in the undivided state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nKeshava Rao’s decision\n\nKeshava Rao announced the decision to leave the BRS and join the grand old party after a meeting with BRS supremo K Chandrashekar Rao on Thursday, 28 March.\n\nA heated discussion is understood to have taken place when Keshava Rao told KCR that he had made up his mind to return to the Congress.\n\nWhen Keshva Rao was trying to explain his reasons, KCR reportedly interrupted, asking him to spare him the talk.\n\nKCR demanded to know why he was leaving when the party had made him a Rajya Sabha member twice, made his daughter the Hyderabad mayor, and given him a good position in the party.\n\nCut to the quick, Keshava Rao is understood to have left the meeting in a huff.\n\nAfter the meeting, Keshava Rao said that he had decided to leave the BRS as he was pining for the days he had spent in the Congress.\n\n“At the age of 80, I am longing to be back in the Congress,” he said, pointing out that he had spent most of his political life in the national party.\n\n“I have very high regard for KCR. He treated me with respect. I discussed Kavitha’s arrest with KCR and felt that she had been framed in the case,” he said.\n\nAfter the Congress began losing sheen, K Chandrashekar Rao — leading what was then the TRS — took over the leadership of the Telangana movement.\n\nThat was when Keshava Rao joined the pink party — in 2013. He was a Rajya Sabha member from the Congress back then.\n\nAfter the creation of Telangana in 2014, KCR sent him to the Rajya Sabha afresh, and again in 2020.\n\nHe was made secretary general of the BRS and the parliamentary party leader. He has been its voice and identity in Delhi for the last 10 years.\n\nFirst doubts over whether everything was alright in the BRS camp emerged when the ED arrested Kavitha at her residence on 15 March for her suspected involvement in the Delhi liquor scam.\n\nWhen the legions of the party came out in support of Kavitha, Keshava Rao was nowhere to be seen — either in Hyderabad or in Delhi.\n\nWhen BRS MPs attended a press conference after her arrest, Keshava Rao was conspicuous by his absence.\n\nAlso Read: Substantial BRS bond receipts redeemed at the altar of favour exchange\n\nSiblings differ\n\nAccording to sources, Vijayalaxmi is expected to don the Congress robes along with her father and 10 trusted corporators.\n\nVijayalaxmi later told reporters that she had decided to move to the Congress along with her father since it was always better to be in the ruling party, as it would become easy to get works done for Hyderabad city.\n\nKeshava Rao’s son Viplav Kumar, however, differed from his father and sister.\n\nHe said he had decided to stay with the BRS and support KCR, and that he had nothing to do with their decision to quit the pink party and join the Congress.\n\nAccording to sources, Revanth Reddy reached out to Keshava Rao and his daughter to smite a blow to the BRS in Hyderabad, where the Congress did not fare well in last year’s Assembly election.\n\nIf Keshava Rao and his daughter were on the Congress’ side, it might become easy for the chief minister to improve the party’s footprint in Lok Sabha constituencies spread across GHMC limits.\n\nHe has managed to onboard several city leaders. The BRS’ Khairtabad MLA Danam Nagender also joined the party recently, and he is now its candidate for the Secunderabad Lok Sabha seat.",

        "text": "Gadwal: The recent political developments in Gadwal politics, particularly involving MLA Krishna Mohan Reddy, are creating a buzz among locals and political analysts alike. There is speculation about whether Krishna Mohan Reddy is stepping down from BRS party, which some believe could lead to significant changes in the constituency.\n\n\n\nPolitical analysts suggest that true development in the constituency could be better achieved if these rumors are accurate, allowing for new leadership that focuses more on public welfare than party politics. Locals are expressing a strong desire for leaders who prioritize the well-being of the public over party affiliations, indicating a shift in public sentiment towards developmental politics over factionalism.\n\nIt's important to keep an eye on these developments to see how they unfold and impact the future of the Gadwal constituency.\n\nYes, there are reports suggesting that several BRS MLAs and key leaders are considering leaving the party following their disappointing performance in the 2024 MP elections, where they did not secure any of the 17 contested seats. Some members have already left, and more are preparing to depart. There is also speculation about potential changes in the party's leadership positions, including the roles of the BRS party president and working president. These rumors are gaining traction on social media, indicating a possible shift in the party's internal dynamics.\n\nThere is widespread speculation that Gadwal MLA Krishna Mohan Reddy may be changing parties, which has led to discussions about the potential impact on the local political landscape. If he does leave the BRS, it would further the trend of leaders exiting the party, as seen across various constituencies in the state. This exodus is metaphorically described as leaders \"getting down from the car,\" leaving the \"pink nest\" of the BRS empty.\n\nPolitical analysts suggest that if Krishna Mohan Reddy joins the Congress party, it could lead to significant development in the Gadwal constituency. They emphasize the importance of prioritizing public welfare over party loyalty and factionalism, advocating for a focus on the constituency's growth and development. This sentiment is resonating with many locals who desire effective leadership that works towards public welfare rather than being entrenched in party politics.\n\nLocals believe that Gadwal MLA Krishna Mohan Reddy should consider changing parties not for personal gain but for the betterment of the constituency. They emphasize the necessity of being aligned with the ruling party to effectively work towards local development. The decision to change parties should reflect the collective input of BRS party workers who contributed to his victory in the last election, rather than being driven by his own preferences.\n\nKrishna Mohan Reddy, who won the 2019 assembly elections as a BRS party candidate, and Sarita Tirupathaiah, who was elected as the ZP TC from BRS and became the chair person of the Gadwal district, highlight the importance of considering the broader impact on the constituency's progress and welfare.\n\nInitially, both Krishna Mohan Reddy and Sarita Jogulamba worked collaboratively for the district's development, aligning their efforts to please and persuade the party leadership. However, over time, differences emerged between the two. This rift led to speculation that Sarita might switch parties. After making the switch, Sarita began organizing programs in her own style, becoming more accessible to the public and gaining their support.\n\nDespite the challenges, Krishna Mohan Reddy remained with the BRS party. In the last election, both leaders faced a tough contest but managed to secure the people's approval with a narrow majority. Their journey reflects the complex dynamics within the party and the importance of public connection and development-focused initiatives.\n\nAn example of this delicate balance is the narrow majority difference observed in past elections. If MLA Krishna Mohan Reddy decides to join the Congress party, the public is hopeful that he and Sarita tirupathaiah can overcome past differences and egos to unite for the party's and constituency's development.\n\nSarita, who already joined the Congress party, set a precedent by working closely with the community and gaining their trust. If Krishna Mohan Reddy follows suit, the local populace wonders about the impact on leaders from other parties in Gadwal, particularly the BJP and BRS. The hope is that, with both Krishna Mohan Reddy and Sarita in the Congress party, they can avoid the previous conflicts experienced within the BRS and collaborate effectively to advance the constituency's development.",

Months later, she contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Mahbubnagar and lost. She was appointed as BJP vice-president in September 2020.\n\nIn a tough fight in the recently held Lok Sabha elections, Aruna defeated Vamshi Chand Reddy of the Congress. Her family’s connections at gross root level and her assurance to voters to focus on local development with central funds, helped her romp home. Even after the Congress utilised all the machinery to defeat her, Aruna won the Mahbubnagar Lok Sabha seat where all the seven Assembly segments are with the Congress.\n\nShe participated in an agitation after the power bills had steeply increased during the previous Chandrababu Naidu government in undivided AP.

After waiting for some time, Mr. Vijayudu went ahead and switched on the motors despite officials objecting to it, resulting in a heated argument.\n\nThe authorities switched off the motors within a few minutes as they wanted Mr. Sampath Kumar to be present there.
