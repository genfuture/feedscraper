He emphasized that while farmers who cultivate cotton seeds continue to drown in debt, middlemen and company organizers are amassing wealth due to their exploitation.\n\nPrakash highlighted that in the past, farmers were required to pass GOT (Grow Out Test) before transporting the remaining seeds. However, now the entire stock is taken, and farmers are falsely informed of test failures, leading to deceit. Additionally, farmers are being burdened with excessive ginning charges and unwarranted insurance fees. He pointed out that ginning charges are being collected at rates far above the norms set by the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), further increasing the financial burden on farmers.\n\nPrakash also demanded an immediate increase in the rates on seed packets to match the rising input costs incurred by farmers. He called upon higher authorities to intervene promptly and organize awareness sessions at Rythu Vedikas to educate farmers about these exploitations and provide them relief from middlemen’s predatory practices.\n\nProminent attendees at the program included Bhandari Sunand and other speakers who actively supported the cause.\n\nReview\n\nThe press meet effectively shed light on critical issues faced by cotton seed farmers, such as unethical practices by middlemen, exploitation under false pretenses, and violations of norms related to ginning and insurance charges. Prakash's demand for higher rates on seed packets and his call for awareness sessions is a step in the right direction to empower farmers and protect them from financial exploitation. Authorities must act swiftly to implement these suggestions, ensuring transparency and fair practices in the cotton seed supply chain.",

Despite central government funding for providing mid-day meals to students from Class 1 to Class 8, the state government has failed to deliver even for Classes 9 and 10.\n\nThe situation in Aija ZPHS Boys School, where over 500 students are enrolled, highlights the dire state of affairs. The school lacks a proper kitchen facility, forcing food preparation to take place outdoors using firewood. Moreover, there is no government-appointed staff to oversee the meal distribution. Basic amenities such as clean drinking water are inadequate, and students are struggling due to the lack of proper sanitation facilities.\n\nKey Issues Raised:\n\n1. Students are not receiving nutritious meals due to insufficient funding and poor infrastructure. For instance, a mere ₹5 is allotted for one meal, while the actual cost in the market is ₹7.\n\n2. The school lacks sufficient water facilities and clean restrooms.\n\n3. Many government schools across the district are in a dilapidated state. Repeated appeals to the government for constructing new buildings have been ignored.\n\n4. Kitchen facilities are unavailable in most schools, forcing food preparation to occur in unhygienic outdoor conditions.\n\n5. Cooking agencies are not being paid on time, further impacting meal quality.\n\nDemands from BJP:\n\n1. Provide students with nutritious meals and proper facilities.\n\n2. Ensure the availability of clean drinking water and hygienic restrooms in schools.\n\n3. Replace dilapidated school buildings with new constructions.\n\n4. Establish proper kitchens equipped with gas stoves for food preparation.\n\n5. Ensure timely payment of bills to cooking agencies.\n\nBJP district president S. Ramachandra Reddy declared that if these demands are not met immediately, the party will escalate protests at various levels to safeguard students' welfare. He affirmed the BJP's commitment to fighting for the rights of students until tangible results are achieved.\n\nParticipants:\n\nThe event saw participation from key BJP leaders, including Mandal BJP President Gopalakrishna, State Kisan Morcha Committee Member Medikonda Bhimsen Rao, Municipal General Secretaries Kampati Bhagat Reddy and Pradeep Swami, District OBC Morcha General Secretary Venkatesh Yadav, OBC Morcha Committee Member Lakshmanachari, and Town Kisan Morcha President Veeresh Goud, among others.",

Locals have expressed concerns about the damage and the environmental impact of the water loss.\n\nAlso Read: Confidential Family Survey Documents Found Discarded on Road in Medchal\n\n“Water is a precious resource, and it is disheartening to see so much of it being wasted due to such technical failures. The government needs to address these issues immediately,” said a resident of the area.\n\nImpact on Water Supply and Local Communities\n\nThe Mission Bhagiratha project, launched by the Telangana government, is intended to supply drinking water to rural areas, but incidents like this pipeline burst raise questions about the reliability and maintenance of the infrastructure. While the pipeline rupture has been quickly reported, immediate repairs are necessary to prevent further wastage and disruption in water supply.\n\nThe rupture has also affected the nearby localities that depend on the water supply for daily use. Locals have urged authorities to address the problem urgently to restore water access.\n\nGovernment Response and Repairs Underway\n\nOfficials from the Telangana Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Department (TDWSSD) have been alerted about the situation, and repair work has reportedly begun. The government has committed to resolving the issue swiftly to ensure that residents of Dharur Mandal and surrounding areas continue to receive their regular water supply.\n\n“We are aware of the leak in the Mission Bhagiratha pipeline near Kothula Gidda and are taking immediate steps to repair the damage. Our teams are on the ground to fix the issue and prevent further wastage,” said a government official.\n\nCall for Better Maintenance and Infrastructure Upgrades\n\nThe incident has sparked concerns about the overall maintenance and longevity of the Mission Bhagiratha pipeline network, especially as the state pushes forward with water supply projects in rural areas. Experts have stressed the need for regular inspections and timely repairs to avoid such issues in the future.\n\nWith water conservation becoming an urgent priority in many regions, ensuring the efficiency of large-scale water supply projects like Mission Bhagiratha is essential for meeting the needs of rural communities across Telangana.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the pipeline burst in Gadwal district highlights the challenges of maintaining vast infrastructure projects, the Telangana government’s quick response aims to minimize the damage. As work on repairs continues, authorities are working to ensure that the water wastage is stopped and that the supply remains uninterrupted for the affected communities.",

Rajeshwari reportedly took her own life after alleged harassment and false accusations of theft by her employer, a prominent local seed organizer.\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread public and political outcry, with allegations of police negligence and favoritism due to the accused’s influential connections. According to reports, Rajeshwari was employed as a domestic worker at the home of Bandla Rajasekhar Reddy, a known seed organizer in Gadwal. The family and BRS leaders allege that Reddy accused her of theft, pressuring her under the weight of unsubstantiated claims. Unable to bear the humiliation, Rajeshwari is said to have consumed pesticide, which led to her tragic death.\n\nBRS leaders, along with activists from the Nadigadda Rights Struggle Committee, visited Rajeshwari’s family to offer condolences and pledged their support in seeking justice. During the visit, Dr. RS Praveen Kumar condemned the alleged mistreatment of the minor girl and criticized the police for initially omitting Reddy’s name from the First Information Report (FIR). He accused local law enforcement of showing bias by protecting the accused due to his political influence.\n\nAddressing the media, Dr. Kumar called for immediate and strict action against Reddy, along with an impartial investigation into the role of\n\nlocal police officers who allegedly mishandled the case. \"We will not rest until those responsible for this innocent girl's death are brought to justice,\" he stated, adding that justice for Rajeshwari should serve as a deterrent to prevent the exploitation of minors in the future.\n\nFormer minister Srinivas Goud echoed these sentiments, demanding that Reddy be held accountable for his actions. \"Exploitation and abuse of vulnerable communities cannot be tolerated. We will ensure this case does not go ignored,\" he said.Local activists and leaders from multiple organizations held a rally in support of Rajeshwari's family, urging authorities to investigate the broader influence of seed organizers in the district. They argue that some powerful figures use their connections to avoid accountability, further marginalizing vulnerable groups.\n\nThe BRS leaders also highlighted the need for stronger protections for minors, calling on the government to address the prevalence of child labor and exploitation in rurallabor and exploitation in rural areas. They expressed concerns that Rajeshwari's case represents broader issues facing marginalized families in Telangana, urging the state to implement policies to protect children from similar fates.\n\nAs the case continues to unfold, calls for a fair and transparent investigation grow louder, with the BRS leadership pledging to pursue justice relentlessly. Rajeshwari's death has not only brought attention to her personal tragedy but has also sparked a wider Conversation about child exploitation and power dynamics, and police accountability.",

        "text": "Mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi Mandates Facial Recognition Attendance for All GHMC Employees\n\n*Hyderabad, November 6* – Mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi has declared that all employees of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) must register for the facial recognition attendance system, underlining that non-compliance will lead to strict disciplinary action against the respective Heads of Departments (HODs). The announcement came after a surprise inspection at the GHMC headquarters, where the Mayor conducted a thorough review of operations across the Town Planning, Health, and Veterinary Departments.\n\n\n\nDuring the inspection, Mayor Vijayalakshmi met with Additional Commissioners and HODs to stress that the use of the facial recognition system is mandatory for all GHMC staff, including permanent and outsourced employees. She made it clear that any failures in implementing this directive would result in consequences for department heads.\n\n\n\nA significant focus of the inspection was the reporting of outsourced staff. The Mayor questioned the Additional Commissioner about the exact number of outsourced employees at the GHMC headquarters and noted inconsistencies in reporting. To address this, she instructed officials to submit detailed records verifying the authorization of all outsourced hirings by the Commissioner.\n\n\n\nAs part of her directive to strengthen administrative oversight, the Mayor mandated that the attendance system should encompass all employees who are on the GHMC payroll, spanning all departments. Future recruitment processes for outsourced personnel are to be conducted solely at the GHMC head office to ensure centralized management and transparency.\n\n\n\nMayor Vijayalakshmi also highlighted the need for a swift and effective response to public grievances. She instructed officials to resolve citizen complaints promptly and to prevent recurrence of the same issues. If a complaint cannot be resolved, officials must provide the applicant with a written explanation. The Mayor warned that failure to adhere to this directive would result in disciplinary action for the respective department heads.\n\n\n\nThe new measure is aimed at boosting accountability, reducing absenteeism, and ensuring streamlined operations within the GHMC. By implementing facial recognition technology, the GHMC aims to modernize its workforce management and enhance service delivery to the residents of Hyderabad.",
